# CochlearModel

Using a linear coclear geometry model and a differential evolution algorithm (DEa), this software predict real NRT response

# Description


# How to use
main file is 'Rundeopt.m' 

# Folders explanation
- bases: contain matlab workspace '.mat' with the variable 'V' (potential) after comsol calculation.
- comsol: contains main code in comsol simulation.
- currentInputs: contains '.csv' files for different model input (WB, bEIF).
- images: contains the output images.
- models: contains '.mph' files (comsol model file)
- optimizado: contains '.mat' with the optimizer results (FVr_x, d, S, W_)
- pacientes: contains '.mat' workspace for all patient data.
- resultados: contains '.csv' with different outputs such as simulated NRT
